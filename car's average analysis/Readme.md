# Car Mileage Analysis

This project analyzes car mileage based on manufacturing companies and their countries of origin. It investigates factors affecting a car's mileage, such as engine size, cylinder count, weight, and top speed. Regression analysis and correlation methods are used to uncover relationships between these variables.
